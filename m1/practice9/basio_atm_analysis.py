Programmed by: Yma Khaliya L. Basio

Program Description: This program creates a deposit module that validates the deposit amount, deposits money into an Account object,
and saves the transaction information to a file.
Reflection: I learned how to create a deposit function that works with an Account object and saves successful transactions 
with a timestamp.
